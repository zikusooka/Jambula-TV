An additional\n      advantage is that encoding video at high frame rates is a\n      processor intensive task when for the most part a very high\n      frame rate offers little perceptible improvement over one that\n      has a more manageable resource requirement. Note, this option\n      is implemented as a cap beyond which binary reduction takes\n      place. So if you have a device capturing at 15fps and set this\n      option to 10fps then the video is not produced at 10fps, but\n      rather at 7.5fps (15 divided by 2) as the final frame rate must\n      be the original divided by a power of 2.\n      ','medband',0,NULL),(78,'ZM_WEB_POPUP_ON_ALARM','1','boolean','yes','yes|no','(?^i:^([yn]))',' ($1 =~ /^y/) ? \'yes\' : \'no\' ','Should the monitor window jump to the top if an alarm occurs','\n      When viewing a live monitor stream you can specify whether you\n      want the window to pop to the front if an alarm occurs when the\n      window is minimised or behind another window.

Choosing \'http\' means the refresh instruction is put in\n      the HTTP header.

However these are less\n      widely supported and content may be specifically tailored to a\n      particular platform or player. This option controls whether\n      media content is enclosed in EMBED tags only or whether, where\n      appropriate, it is additionally wrapped in OBJECT tags.\n      Currently OBJECT tags are only used in a limited number of\n      circumstances but they may become more widespread in the\n      future.

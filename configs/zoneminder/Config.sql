If an error occurs or if you are using \'fast deletes\' it may be that database records are deleted but files remain. In this case, and similar, zmaudit will remove redundant information to synchronise the two data stores. The default check interval of 900 seconds (15 minutes) is fine for most systems however if you have a very large number of events the process of scanning the database and filesystem may take a long time and impact performance.

However in some circumstances, such as access over mobile networks, the requesting address can change for each request which will cause most requests to fail.

In some circumstances it may be desirable to allow access directly to one or more pages, for instance from a third party application. If this option is enabled then adding an \'auth\' parameter to any request will include a shortcut login bypassing the login screen, if not already logged in. As authentication hashes are time and, optionally, IP limited this can allow short-term access to ZoneMinder screens from other web pages etc. In order to use this the calling application will hae to generate the authentication hash itself and ensure it is valid.

There are two methods for doing this. This first is to use a time limited hashed string which contains no direct username or password details, the second method is to pass the username and passwords around in plaintext. This method is not recommend except where you do not have the md5 libraries available on your system or you have a completely isolated system with no external access.

The first is a builtin method where ZoneMinder provides facilities for users to log in and maintains track of their identity. The second method allows interworking with other methods such as http basic authentication which passes an independently authentication \'remote\' user via http.

This works well in motion detection scenarios but when in a DVR situation (\'Record\' or \'Mocord\' mode) this results in a huge number of frame writes and a lot of database and disk bandwidth for very little additional information. Setting this to a non-zero value will enabled ZoneMinder to group these non-alarm frames into one \'bulk\' frame entry which saves a lot of bandwidth and space. The only disadvantage of this is that timing information for individual frames is lost but in constant frame rate situations this is usually not significant.

Increasing this setting allows you to force additional image captures before one is selected as the captured frame. This allows the capture hardware to \'settle down\' and produce better quality images at the price of lesser capture rates. This option has no effect on (a) network cameras, or (b) where multiple inputs do not share a capture chip. This option addresses a similar problem to the ZM_V4L_MULTI_BUFFER option and you should normally change the value of only one of the options at a time.

To save checking manually for each new version ZoneMinder can check with the zoneminder.com website to determine the most recent release. These checks are infrequent, about once per week, and no personal or system information is transmitted other than your current version number.

This saves a small amount of disk space over colour ones. However some tools such as ffmpeg either fail to work with this colour space or have to convert it beforehand.

This can be very useful during zone configuration or in analysing why events occured. However it also incurs some overhead and in a stable system may no longer be necessary.

However in some cases it is easier to diagnose the error if a core file, which is a memory dump of the process at the time of the error, is created. This can be interactively analysed in the debugger and may reveal more or better information than that available from the logs. This option is recommended for advanced users only otherwise leave at the default. Note using this option to trigger core files will mean that there will be no indication in the binary logs that a process has died, they will just stop, however the zmdc log will still contain an entry.

The \'idle\' setting means that the event will be closed at the end of the section if there is no alarm activity occuring at the time otherwise it will be closed once the alarm is over meaning the event may end up being longer than the normal section length.

This option determines what method they should use to do this. Choosing \'javascript\' means that each window will have a short JavaScript statement in with a timer to prompt the refresh. This is the most compatible method. Choosing \'http\' means the refresh instruction is put in the HTTP header. This is a cleaner method but refreshes are interrupted or cancelled when a link in the window is clicked meaning that the window will no longer refresh and this would have to be done manually.','hidden',0,''),(70,'ZM_WEB_RESIZE_CONSOLE','1','boolean','yes','yes|no','(?^i:^([yn]))',' ($1 =~ /^y/) ? \"yes\" : \"no\" ','Should the console window resize itself to fit','Traditionally the main ZoneMinder web console window has resized itself to shrink to a size small enough to list only the monitors that are actually present. This is intended to make the window more unobtrusize but may not be to everyones tastes, especially if opened in a tab in browsers which support this kind if layout. Switch this option off to have the console window size left to the users preference','web',0,''),(76,'ZM_WEB_SOUND_ON_ALARM','0','boolean','no','yes|no','(?^i:^([yn]))',' ($1 =~ /^y/) ? \"yes\" : \"no\" ','Should the monitor window play a sound if an alarm occurs','When viewing a live monitor stream you can specify whether you want the window to play a sound to alert you if an alarm occurs.','web',0,''),(69,'ZM_WEB_TITLE_PREFIX','Jambula-Eye','string','ZM','string','(?^:^(.+)$)',' $1 ','The title prefix displayed on each window','If you have more than one installation of ZoneMinder it can be helpful to display different titles for each one. Changing this option allows you to customise the window titles to include further information to aid identification.','web',0,''),(149,'ZM_WEB_USE_OBJECT_TAGS','1','boolean','yes','yes|no','(?^i:^([yn]))',' ($1 =~ /^y/) ? \"yes\" : \"no\" ','Wrap embed in object tags for media content','There are two methods of including media content in web pages. The most common way is use the EMBED tag which is able to give some indication of the type of content. However this is not a standard part of HTML. The official method is to use OBJECT tags which are able to give more information allowing the correct media viewers etc to be loaded. However these are less widely supported and content may be specifically tailored to a particular platform or player. This option controls whether media content is enclosed in EMBED tags only or whether, where appropriate, it is additionally wrapped in OBJECT tags. Currently OBJECT tags are only used in a limited number of circumstances but they may become more widespread in the future. It is suggested that you leave this option on unless you encounter problems playing some content.','web',0,''),(131,'ZM_WEIGHTED_ALARM_CENTRES','0','boolean','no','yes|no','(?^i:^([yn]))',' ($1 =~ /^y/) ? \"yes\" : \"no\" ','Use a weighted algorithm to calculate the centre of an alarm','ZoneMinder will always calculate the centre point of an alarm in a zone to give some indication of where on the screen it is. This can be used by the experimental motion tracking feature or your own custom extensions. In the alarmed or filtered pixels mode this is a simple midpoint between the extents of the detected pxiesl. However in the blob method this can instead be calculated using weighted pixel locations to give more accurate positioning for irregularly shaped blobs. This method, while more precise is also slower and so is turned off by default.','config',0,''),(75,'ZM_X10_DB_RELOAD_INTERVAL','60','integer','60','integer','(?^:^(d+)$)',' $1 ','How often (in seconds) the X10 daemon reloads the monitors from the database','The zmx10 daemon periodically checks the database to find out what X10 events trigger, or result from, alarms. This option determines how frequently this check occurs, unless you change this area frequently this can be a fairly large value.','x10',0,'ZM_OPT_X10=1'),(73,'ZM_X10_DEVICE','/dev/ttyS0','string','/dev/ttyS0','/absolute/path/to/somewhere','(?^:^((?:/[^/]*)+?)/?$)',' $1 ','What device is your X10 controller connected on','If you have an X10 controller device (e.g. XM10U) connected to your computer this option details which port it is conected on, the default of /dev/ttyS0 maps to serial or com port 1.','x10',0,'ZM_OPT_X10=1'),(74,'ZM_X10_HOUSE_CODE','A','string','A','A-P','(?^i:^([A-P]))',' uc($1) ','What X10 house code should be used','X10 devices are grouped together by identifying them as all belonging to one House Code. This option details what that is. It should be a single letter between A and P.','x10',0,'ZM_OPT_X10=1');

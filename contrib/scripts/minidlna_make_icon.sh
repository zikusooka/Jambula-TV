#
#        where ${debian_svg_logo} is the name of the SVG logo you want to
#        convert. Currently, the Debian SVG logo without the "Debian" text can
#        be obtained with:
#
#        wget http://www.debian.org/logos/openlogo-nd.svg
#
#        You'll need to have inkscape and imagemagick installed for this script
#        to work.
